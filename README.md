# Magnetosuture

Implemented the research paper MagnetoSuture: Tetherless Manipulation of Suture Needles by Professor Axel Krieger. This was done as a project for the course Control of Robotic Systems. Wrote a MATLAB code for a PD controller that could drive the needle in a specific path. In the paper, visual feedback was taken but in my implementation, I compared the actual trajectory with the desired trajectory that is defined explicitly as a circle.Â
